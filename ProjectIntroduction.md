# Project Introduction
We decided to undertake the visual servoing tracking robot project, this is because we felt it would teach us skills that would become very useful in both out later education and later careers. The Goal of this task is to design and construct a robot and system that can be controlled to track a recognizable object (a face, a ball, a toy, ect) and follow it arround while it's in view of the camera.  
To accomplish this goal we decided to make two small robotic arms with 3 DOF each, these will work together with one performing a pre programed task whilst the other arm attempts to mimic it. An expansion on this project would be to adapt it into an AI, this would allow a robot to observe and mimic a task performed by another robot, store the operation it performed for later use, mimicing human learning.
