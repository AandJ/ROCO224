# Kinematics of Arm

## Introduction
Calculation of the Kinematics is essential for controlling the robot, the transform functions describe the relationship between the frames for each LINK, these can then be used in the forward kinematics which allows us to work out the exact position and orientation of the end effector. The inverse kinematics is the most use full allowing us to calculate the needed joint angles to put the end effector in a specific position.  

## Transform functions
To get the transform functions for our arm we used the Denavitâ€“Hartenberg parameters.

Now that we had our transform functions we wanted to check if these where correct, to do this we used the rvc (Robotics, Vision and Control) toolbox in MATLAB.  
We did this by using the "link" type classification and the SerialLink command to describe our robots parameters, we then used SerialLink.plot and SerialLink.animate to create a graphical representation of our robots kinematics. This is shown below.

## Forward kinematics
To obtain the forward kinematics we need to times all the transform function together, this allows us to work out the position of the end effector frame at the current joint positions.
This can be done in MATLAB using the "SerialLink.fkine" command. `FwrdKin = R.fkine(JOINTS);` would determine the position of the end effector for the joint states specified by the "JOINTS" variable.  

## Inverse kinematics
### Inverse kinematics by optimisation without joint limits
We wanted to perform Inverse kinematics so that our arm can move to a specific position, this is necessary for moving to a desired start position as well as moving to the location of the bowl to place the balls in.  
The inverse kinematics for our arm was made more complicated due to the design not having a wrist, this meant the arm was under actuated and so its end effector Rx and Ry components were set by its position and could not be modified. To overcome this issue we used a MATLAB inverse kinematic solver that would mask out these components. The command we used was `SerialLink.ikine(q, options)` also called "Inverse kinematics by optimisation without joint limits" we used several of the options to get this to function for our design, the most important was the mask, this allowed us to mask the unnecessary components of the transform, we also used the options "verbose" "slimit" and "q0".

### Inverse manipulator by optimisation without joint limits
We also wanted to perform inverse kinematics whilst considering the rotational components, this would be used whilst iterating towards the ball. To do this we used the `SerialLink.ikunc(T, Q0, Options)` command which performs inverse kinematics with initial Joints "Q0" to the specified transform "T", We decided to use this command as we would be iterating with small increments. The use of this is discussed more in the MATLAB section on the function "TO_BALL()".
